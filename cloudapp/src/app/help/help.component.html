  The app only works when there are itemized sets of physical items on the Alma page . Start the app
  and choose set you would like to add in to. Scan manually : includes using of keyboard to type or
  barcode scanner. Upload file : upload .txt file with barcodes such that each barcode is seperated
  by a line break.

  <li>
    Make sure all the barcodes you scan are correct , if there is one bad barcode than the operation
    will fail
  </li>
</ul>
